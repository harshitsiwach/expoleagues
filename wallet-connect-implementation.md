## Testing Notes

The wallet connect functionality has been implemented and should work correctly when:
1. A compatible wallet is installed (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)
2. The app is running on a mobile device or emulator
3. The wallet is properly configured

## Known Issues

1. **Web Environment**: The app still has issues running in web browsers due to React Native Reanimated conflicts
2. **Development Environment**: Testing requires a physical device or emulator to fully validate wallet connection

## Next Steps

1. Test on physical Android/iOS devices
2. Verify compatibility with various wallet providers
3. Add support for wallet-specific features (network switching, etc.)
