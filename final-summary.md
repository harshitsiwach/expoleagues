# Liquid Glass Crypto Fantasy App - Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to get the Liquid Glass Crypto Fantasy app running properly.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies
- Installed `@walletconnect/react-native-compat` to resolve WalletConnect compatibility issues
- Installed `react-native-get-random-values` for crypto functionality
- Installed `@react-native-community/netinfo` for network connectivity
- Installed `react-native-modal` for modal components
- Installed `@walletconnect/utils`, `@walletconnect/core`, and `@walletconnect/sign-client` for WalletConnect functionality

### 2. Configuration Issues
- Updated `.env` file to use Expo environment variables format:
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Updated `lib/web3/config.ts` to use the correct environment variable names
- Updated `lib/api/supabase.ts` to handle both web and native environments

### 3. Route Files
- Created proper implementations for empty route files:
  - `app/hyperliquid.tsx`
  - `app/my-teams.tsx`
  - `app/profile.tsx`

### 4. AsyncStorage Issues
- Created a mock storage solution for web environments to avoid `window is not defined` errors
- Implemented conditional loading of AsyncStorage based on environment

### 5. Documentation
- Created `fixes-summary.md` to document all fixes applied
- Updated error handling in Supabase configuration

## Remaining Issues

### React Native Reanimated
The app is still experiencing issues with react-native-reanimated. The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'level')" suggests there's a problem with the logger in the reanimated library.

### Environment Setup
The app requires either:
1. Android development environment with connected device or emulator
2. iOS development environment with Xcode installed

## Recommendations

1. Try running the app in development mode instead of web mode
2. Consider downgrading react-native-reanimated if issues persist
3. Set up Android or iOS development environment for proper testing
4. Update AsyncStorage and react-native-svg to versions compatible with Expo SDK 54
