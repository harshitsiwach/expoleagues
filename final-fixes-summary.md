## Current Status

The app should now run properly on Android or iOS devices/emulators. The remaining issue is environment-related:

- **No Android device or emulator connected**: To test the app, you need to either:
  1. Connect an Android device with USB debugging enabled
  2. Create and start an Android emulator through Android Studio
  3. Use Expo Go app on a physical device

## Recommendations

1. Set up Android development environment:
   - Install Android Studio
   - Create an Android Virtual Device (AVD)
   - Ensure ADB is properly configured

2. If continuing to experience memory issues:
   - Consider using a machine with more RAM
   - Try running the app in development mode instead of production
   - Review dependencies for unnecessary packages that might increase bundle size

3. For WalletConnect warnings:
   - These are mostly informational and may not affect functionality
   - Consider reaching out to package maintainers about export issues
