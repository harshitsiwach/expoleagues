# Fixing the Liquid Glass Crypto Fantasy App

## Issues Encountered and Fixes Applied

### 1. Missing Dependencies
- Installed `@walletconnect/react-native-compat` to resolve WalletConnect compatibility issues
- Installed `react-native-get-random-values` for crypto functionality
- Installed `@react-native-community/netinfo` for network connectivity
- Installed `react-native-modal` for modal components
- Installed `@walletconnect/utils`, `@walletconnect/core`, and `@walletconnect/sign-client` for WalletConnect functionality

### 2. Configuration Issues
- Updated `.env` file to use Expo environment variables format:
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Updated `lib/web3/config.ts` to use the correct environment variable names
- Updated `lib/api/supabase.ts` to handle both web and native environments

### 3. Route Files
- Created proper implementations for empty route files:
  - `app/hyperliquid.tsx`
  - `app/my-teams.tsx`
  - `app/profile.tsx`

### 4. AsyncStorage Issues
- Created a mock storage solution for web environments to avoid `window is not defined` errors
- Implemented conditional loading of AsyncStorage based on environment

### 5. Reanimated Issues
- The app is still experiencing issues with react-native-reanimated
- Need to investigate further or consider downgrading the package

## Next Steps

1. Try running the app in development mode instead of web mode
2. Consider downgrading react-native-reanimated if issues persist
3. Test on a physical device or simulator instead of web browser
